# mp3tag-editor

Pet-project that is used for changing the most commonly used ID3-tags using 2.3 and 2.4 encoding:

* Title
* Artist
* Album
* Genre
* Track (# of #)
* Composer
* BPM

__NOTE:__ This editor seems to distort the mp3-file a little bit. This still needs to be fixed, but I kinda have no idea how it should be managed. Probably, later.
